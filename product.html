      <h2>Virtual Reality (VR) as a Sport Innovation</h2>
      <section class="productArticleSection">
        <article id="productArticle1" class="productArticle"> <!--Article 1-->
          <h2>What is Virtual Reality?</h2>
          <p>
            Virtual Reality (VR) is an interactive virtual environment that uses cameras, sensors, joysticks, and/or costumes to immerse you in a different world.
            This way, users of VR can immerse themselves in a virtual environment, move around, interact with it, 
            without ever leaving the living room, or whichever area the VR installation is installed. 
            Not to be confused with AR, which puts virtual elements in the real world, VR creates a new world and puts the user in it. 
            Virtual Reality in concept originates from the mid 1980&apos;s. Soon after that, the first prototype of goggles, gloves and sensors were developed.
            Now, VR could become another tool to make the world a better, healthier place.

          <h2>VR as a Fix for Modern Obesity</h2>
          <p>
            Virtual Reality can be a fix for obesity. Nowhere is this more true than in the Netherlands, where about 20 percent of the adult population is obese, and rising. 
            What sets the country apart is its focus on a technology called Transformed Reality, a combination of virtual reality and personal electronics.
            The resulting platform is called Mouseview, and it&apos;s designed specifically for obese children, teens and young adults who are struggling to lose weight.

          <h2>How to Set Up VR at Home</h2>
          <p>
            Setting up a VR kit at home is still a bit tricky. Other than the VR kit, headset and sensors, there will have to be a computer that is capable of handling the VR environment.
            If you are ever really going to get into VR, you need to make sure your computer can handle it. 
            A headset like the Oculus Rift is compatible with computers with mid-range Nvidia graphics cards and above.
            The HTC Vive requires at least an AMD Radeon R9 390 or above and is compatible with Nvidia’s Titan X or above.
            Other than the computer, you will need to designate a play area.
            You can move, dance, or dodge around your play area. This requires setting up Roomscale in Guardian, which defines a safe play boundary.
            To begin with, you need an unobstructed area of at least 2 meters by 2 meters.

          <h2>Current Implementations in VR</h2>
          <p>
            Virtual Reality is currently already popular in well developed countries, particularly in in-home use. Besides that, VR is widely implemented in modern sport training. 
            For example, many clubs and international rugby teams are also using virtual reality headsets. 
            It is used to produce simulated rugby scenarios such as line-outs, high balls, and first-phase attacks. 
            This can help the players to improve their cognitive learning and visualisation skills. 
            And just like rugby, also other sports can benefit from the implementation of VR in their training, being able to simulate specific situations within controlled VR environments.

          <h2>Which VR Solutions We Offer</h2>
          <p>
            As discussed, the installation of VR at home or in a training area can be tricky, and will need some technical know-how. 
            Spartan Tech offers you the VR kit and its installation, customised to your needs and situation. This is available in multiple varying packages, 
            specificallyu to be able to meet the requirements which you have.

          <h2>The Future of VR in Sports</h2>
          <p>
            Virtual Reality in sports will only continue to grow. Apart from stimulating exercise within the confines of a home, VR can bring a team or athlete's game up to a whole new dimension
            both on a professional or amateuristic level.
            Investments are being made to continually improve the accuracy and realism within VR, which will improve the quality of VR training for athletes and people at home.
