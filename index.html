          Augmented Reality (AR) brings digital elements into your world.
          HADO is a sport that lets players strap on head-mounted displays and armband sensors to wield energy balls and shields on a real-world court as if by magic.
          Hiroshi Fukuda, founder and CEO of Meleap Inc., dreamed of throwing "hadoken" like in Japanese comics and on TV. 
          This passion burned inside, until HADO was realized as a sport in 2014. 
          Today, players can strap on head-mounted displays and armband sensors to wield energy balls and shields on a real-world court as if by magic.
          This sport is just one example of an AR sport which has become immensely popular in a short time.

          In sports, there are many different types of wearable tech. Professional athletes and casual fitness lovers alike favour Fitbit smartwatches. 
          These are appropriate for a broad variety of activities that need calorie, step, distance, pulse, and heart rate tracking. 
          Other, more specialised instances of wearable technology include “smart clothes.” 
          Heart rate, breathing activity, postures, pace, and weight distribution are all measured by athletic clothing. 
          Instead of collecting perspiration, new clothing is meant to wick it away from the body through evaporation. 
          Even lighter and flatter track shoes are made to achieve the ideal mix of grip and comfort.

          Fan Engagement is one of, if not the primary, area of investment and innovation activity for professional U.S.
          and collegiate sports teams. The focus areas include content creation (leveraging the brand, video and
          storytelling), gameday broadcast production and social interaction with fans. Data is also an important asset
          being leveraged for revenue generation in collaboration with 3rd parties in fantasy sports and betting. There is an
          urgency to retain Gen Z and Gen Alpha fans, delivering a personalised Fan Experience (from game format to media channel and on-demand), as well as to grow the global audience.
          The marketplace for solutions is intensely dynamic, highly competitive and likely to continue as the new digital era unfolds with Web 3.0/Metaverse technologies in the next 2-4 years.
